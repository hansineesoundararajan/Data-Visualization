# Data-Visualization
This project involves exploring a dataset through visualizations to draw meaningful insights, followed by building predictive models based on those observations.
The workflow includes:
Importing and cleaning the dataset,
Visualizing key patterns and distributions,
Making inferences from the visualized data,
Building machine learning prediction models based on the insights.     


This notebook serves as a hands-on demonstration of using data visualization to guide model development and improve understanding of the dataset.
